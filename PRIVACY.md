**Privacy Policy for Raspberry Sync Bot**

Effective Date: \[June 27, 2025]

Raspberry Sync Bot ("the Bot") is designed to assist users in monitoring and synchronizing data from Raspberry Pi devices using rsync. This bot is intended for use by developers and system administrators for automation and reporting.

**1. Data Collection**
The Bot does **not collect**, **store**, or **process** any personal information from users. All commands and interactions are initiated manually or via configured automation and are processed in real time.

**2. Use of Data**
The Bot uses environment-defined variables and filesystem access **locally** within the deployed container or device. Any information displayed via the bot (e.g., disk usage, CPU usage) remains within the user’s infrastructure.

**3. Data Sharing**
The Bot does **not share any data** with third parties. All operations occur between the bot, your Raspberry Pi, and optionally a configured remote server under your control.

**4. Security**
The Bot uses standard secure practices for communication (e.g., SSH for rsync if configured). It does not include user authentication or encryption mechanisms beyond those provided by Telegram and system-level configuration.

**5. Third-Party Services**
This bot runs inside Telegram and follows Telegram’s terms and policies. You can review Telegram’s privacy policy here:

**6. Contact**
For questions or concerns, please contact the developer via GitHub or your deployment channel.

**7. Changes to this Policy**
This policy may be updated from time to time. Users should periodically review it in the source repository or deployment documentation.
